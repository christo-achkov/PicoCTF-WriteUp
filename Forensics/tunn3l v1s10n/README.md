* [file](./tunn3l_v1s10n)

## Solution

1. There is a problem opening the file. Running `file tunn3l_v1s10n` produces `tunn3l_v1s10n: data`, which is not helpful. We can check a [list of file signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) and see if there is a match between the magic bytes. We can see the first bytes in the `tunn3l_v1s10n` file using `xxd -g 1 tunn3l_v1s10n | head`:

    ```

2. The `42 4d` match with a BMP image. We can open this image in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), since it is able to load the image. However, all we see is a weird warped image and a fake flag.

3. We can change the height of the bitmap using a hex editor such as [HexEd.it](https://hexed.it/). The width starts at hex offset `12`, lasts for 4 bytes, and is followed by the height at offset `16`, which is also 4 bytes. The info is on the [BMP Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) under the "Windows `BITMAPINFOHEADER`".

4. Let's set the height to the same number as the width (`6e 04`) since the image looks like part of it was extended outwards. We make the change in the hex editor replacing `32 01` at offset `16` to `6e 04`, save the image, and then load it in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/).
